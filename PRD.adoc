== 1. Title & Version

* *Project Name:* Playwright Browser Agent Demo
* *Version:* 0.1.0

== 2. Overview / Purpose

Demonstrate how an internal engineer can instruct a Large-Language-Model
(LLM)–powered LangGraph agent to drive a Playwright-MCP browser session
end-to-end. The CLI-based demo should highlight real-time streaming of
agent thoughts/actions, optional screenshot capture, and flexible LLM
back-end configuration via LiteLLM.

== 3. Goals & Success Metrics

[width="100%",cols="28%,72%",options="header",]
|===
|Goal |Success Metric
|Allow engineers to issue free-form natural-language commands and watch
the browser comply |Browser visibly completes requested actions in a
live session

|Provide both interactive chat and batch execution modes
|`pb-agent chat` & `pb-agent batch` commands run without error

|Support multiple LLM providers via LiteLLM |Agent works when
corresponding `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` is present in `.env`

|Optional recording of PNG screenshots per step |`--record` flag
produces timestamped PNGs in `artifacts/`
|===

== 4. Assumptions & Constraints

* Python 3.13 is available.
* Dependency management uses `uv` (`uv venv`, `uv add …`).
* Playwright-MCP server is auto-launched by LangGraph tooling (no manual
Node command).
* LLM credentials are supplied via `.env` using LiteLLM conventions
(e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
* Default interaction mode is `snapshot` (accessibility tree); `--mode headless`
  runs without GUI, `--mode vision` uses screenshot-based interaction.
* Network access is unrestricted (no proxy requirements).
* Metrics beyond ``it visibly works'' are out-of-scope.

== 5. User Stories / Use-Cases

[arabic]
. *Interactive Engineer*
* As an engineer, I want to run `pb-agent chat` and type natural
instructions so that I can watch the browser respond step-by-step in
real time.
. *Batch Executor*
* As an engineer, I want to run `pb-agent batch tasks.txt` so that a
series of instructions execute automatically without manual input.
. *Recorder*
* As an engineer, I need to pass `--record` to capture PNG screenshots
for each agent step for later review.
. *Headless Automation*
* As an engineer, I can specify `--mode headless` to suppress the GUI for CI
  pipelines while still capturing screenshots if `--record` is set.
. *Vision Mode Interaction* (Optional/Implied by mode flag)
* As an engineer, I can specify `--mode vision` to use screenshot-based
  visual interaction if needed (e.g., for models requiring visual input).

== 6. Functional Requirements

[arabic]
. *CLI Wrapper*
* Provide an installable console-script `pb-agent`.
* Sub-commands: `chat` and `batch`.
. *Interactive Chat Mode*
* Maintain a single browser/context for the entire conversation.
* Exit when user types `exit` or `bye` (case-insensitive).
. *Batch Mode*
* Accept a plain-text file; treat each non-blank line as a user
instruction.
* After completion, print `Done. Press any key to exit …` and wait for
keyboard input.
. *Streaming Output*
* Stream agent thoughts/actions/observations to STDOUT in real time.
. *Screenshot Recording*
* When `--record` is supplied, capture PNG after each agent action;
store under `artifacts/<timestamp>/step_<N>.png`.
. *Headless Flag*
* `--mode headless` hides the browser UI.
. *Interaction Mode Flag*
* `--mode <mode>` controls the Playwright MCP interaction mode.
* Supported modes: `snapshot` (default, accessibility tree), `headless` (no GUI),
  `vision` (screenshot-based).
* The CLI should pass the appropriate flags (`--headless` or `--vision`)
  to the underlying MCP server based on the selected mode.
. *Config Loading*
* Use `python-dotenv` to load `.env`; allow CLI flags to override key
values.
. *Graceful Shutdown*
* Ensure MCP browser/context and any background processes are closed on
exit.
. *Error Handling*
* Implement retries/timeouts for browser actions; log failures clearly.

== 7. Non-functional Requirements

* *Performance:* Command latency acceptable for demo (< 5 s for typical
navigation).
* *Reliability:* Browser context persists across multiple instructions;
recoverable on minor failures.
* *Security:* Do not expose API keys in logs; avoid arbitrary code
execution from LLM (rely on MCP action set).
* *Portability:* Works on macOS, Linux, Windows WSL given Python 3.13
and Node runtime for MCP (handled by Playwright install script).
* *Usability:* Minimal flags; understandable console output.

_Total: ~7 work-days (1.5 weeks)_

== 10. Acceptance Criteria

* `pip install -e . && pb-agent chat` launches interactive session.
* Browser is visible by default (`--mode snapshot`).
* `--mode headless` hides the browser UI.
* Entering `open https://example.com` (or similar) navigates correctly.
* Typing `exit` ends the session gracefully.
* `pb-agent batch samples/flow.txt --record` processes all lines, writes
PNGs, waits for key-press.
* Works with at least *two* LLM providers by changing `.env` keys.

== 11. Open Questions & Future Work

* Enhance security by adding function-calling schemas / output
validation.
* Support Playwright trace ZIPs for deeper debugging.
* Add web-based UI wrapper (Streamlit) for non-CLI users.
* Multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI, AutoGen) for complex tasks.
