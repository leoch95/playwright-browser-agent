# Planning & Brainstorming Towards a Comprehensive PRD

This rule describes the structured process the AI assistant should follow when a user requests an in-depth planning or brainstorming session that must ultimately result in a Product Requirement Document (PRD).

---

## 1. Goals of the Process
1. Thoroughly understand the user's initiative, vision and constraints.
2. Brainstorm, evaluate and converge on the best solution strategy.
3. Produce a clear, comprehensive **PRD.adoc** file that can be used by designers, engineers and stakeholders.

---

## 2. High-Level Workflow
1. **Initiate Discovery**
   - Prompt the user for high-level objectives, target audience, constraints and success metrics.
   - If relevant, inspect the existing codebase using the available tools (`list_dir`, `codebase_search`, `read_file`, etc.).
2. **Iterative Clarification & Research**
   - Ask *one focused question at a time* to remove ambiguity.
   - Leverage code exploration tools or web research to fill knowledge gaps.
   - Continually summarise confirmed knowledge so the user can correct misunderstandings early.
3. **Solution Ideation & Evaluation**
   - Generate multiple candidate approaches.
   - Compare them against user-defined criteria (feasibility, effort, UX, performance, etc.).
   - Engage the user to select or refine the preferred approach.
4. **Draft Proposal**
   - Present a structured proposal outlining the chosen solution, rationale and open questions.
   - Explicitly ask for the user's approval or further changes.
5. **Finalize PRD**
   - When the user approves the proposal, create **`PRD.adoc`** in the workspace root containing, at minimum:
     1. Title & Version
     2. Overview / Purpose
     3. Goals & Success Metrics
     4. Assumptions & Constraints
     5. User Stories / Use-cases
     6. Functional Requirements
     7. Non-functional Requirements
     8. Solution Architecture / High-level Design
     9. Milestones & Timeline
     10. Acceptance Criteria
     11. Open Questions & Future Work
   - Commit the file via `edit_file` (in AsciiDoc format).

---

## 3. Interaction Guidelines
- Always confirm assumptions with the user.
- Break complex topics into smaller questions.
- Keep the user engaged: after each answer, ask the next most important clarifying question.
- Use the codebase tools freely, but only modify markdown (*.md) or AsciiDoc (*.adoc) files during this planning phase.
- Once the PRD is delivered, return to normal task flow unless the user requests further planning.

## 4. Tool Usage Cheat-Sheet
| Need | Recommended Tool |
|------|------------------|
| See project structure | `list_dir` |
| Find concepts in code | `codebase_search` |
| Inspect file contents | `read_file` |
| Find exact string | `grep_search` |
| Run local script / gather runtime info | `run_terminal_cmd` *(with approval)* |
| Search the web | `web_search` |
| Add / update documentation | `edit_file` |


---

## 5. Exit Criteria
The planning session concludes when:
1. The user explicitly approves the drafted proposal.
2. The **`PRD.adoc`** has been generated and saved in the repository.

The assistant should then summarise next steps or await further instructions.
