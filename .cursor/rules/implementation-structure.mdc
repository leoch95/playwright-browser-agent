# Implementation Structure & File Responsibilities

This rule describes the intended code structure, file responsibilities, and CLI/agent flow for the Playwright Browser Agent project, as specified in [DESIGN.adoc](mdc:DESIGN.adoc) and [PRD.adoc](mdc:PRD.adoc).

---

## Project Layout & File Roles

- [main.py](mdc:main.py): Entrypoint. Should invoke the Typer CLI app (from `cli.py`).
- cli.py: Defines the `pb-agent` CLI with `chat` and `batch` subcommands, using Typer. Handles CLI flags for provider, model, headless, record, etc.
- config.py: Loads environment variables (via python-dotenv), merges model config JSON, applies CLI overrides, and validates required API keys.
- agent.py: Implements the LangGraph agent, wiring up LiteLLM and Playwright-MCP. Exposes `run_chat_loop()` and `send()` for interactive and batch modes.
- prompts.py: Builds system prompt templates, optionally including screenshot instructions if `--record` is set.
- utils.py: Helpers for timestamping, keypress wait, and graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM handling).
- [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml): Declares dependencies and the `pb-agent` console script entrypoint.

---

## CLI & Agent Flow

- `pb-agent chat`: Starts an interactive session. Maintains a single browser/context. Exits on `exit`/`bye`.
- `pb-agent batch <file>`: Reads instructions from a file, executes each line, and waits for keypress at end.
- Both modes support `--headless` (run browser headless) and `--record` (save PNG screenshots after each step).
- Streaming output: Agent thoughts/actions/observations are streamed to STDOUT in real time.
- On exit or signal, the Python application cleans up its resources. Management of the external Playwright MCP server is handled separately.

---

## Implementation Notes

- All config is loaded via config.py, with CLI flags taking precedence over .env.
- The agent uses LiteLLM for LLM abstraction and `langchain-mcp-adapters` to connect the LangGraph agent to the externally managed Playwright-MCP server (`@playwright/mcp` Node process).
- Screenshot PNGs (if `--record`) are saved under `artifacts/<timestamp>/step_<N>.png`.
- Error handling: Retries/timeouts for browser actions, clear logging of failures.
